// This week's specials shelf: a virtual, code-defined category (not a real
// Square category) pinned first on the Menu tab. Square holds the CURRENT
// (discounted) price directly — Stan edits it there. This file is the only
// place the ORIGINAL price is remembered, so the UI can show the
// struck-through comparison. Kept in sync with the web repo's config of the
// same name (src/lib/menu/weekly-specials.ts) — update both when the promo
// rotates.
//
// Names must match the Square catalog item name (case-insensitive, and runs
// of whitespace count as one — see normalizeItemName). A mismatch fails
// silently (the item just won't show as a special), so double-check against
// Square Dashboard > Items, not the poster copy.
