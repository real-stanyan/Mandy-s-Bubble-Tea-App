// The order hero (components/brand/OrderHero): what is happening to the
// customer's drinks right now, drawn on the order page while they wait.
// Pure phase→frame maths for its moving parts; which cups it draws is
// lib/menu/order-cups, the same as the checkout heroes.
//
// The shop is 手摇 — hand-shaken — so the tin is the centre of the Preparing
// scene and gets a third of the loop to itself. Everything else is the order
// a drink is actually built in: pearls into the cup, shake, pour over, seal,
// straw, away.
//
// ONE RULE runs through this file: every frame function must return the same
// frame at p = 1 as at p = 0. A loop whose parts don't agree at the seam shows
// a visible jump once a cycle, which is what the first cut of this scene did
// (the cup shrank away to nothing and then snapped back to full size). The
// test asserts it for every export rather than trusting the reading.
//
// Mirror of the web's src/lib/motion/order-hero.ts. Keep the two in lockstep —
// same numbers, same beats, and the same test on both sides.
//
// The one difference is the 'worklet' directives. Over there these run in a
// requestAnimationFrame writing matrices onto DOM nodes; here they run on the
// UI thread inside useAnimatedProps, and Reanimated has to be told. Everything
// a Motion's `frame` can reach needs one — the closures the factories return
// included, and the easing helpers those call.
